## Project Name: RecommendMe

### Description
This project solves the issue of students at UMD who do not know what classes to take. Searching on Testudo simply returns a query based on some specified filters and may not be as helpful. In this project, we attempt to mimic LLM and provide the user the ability to provide custom inputs on the type of classes that they may be interested in. 

For instance, these are some prompts that a student might enter into our application:
* Recommend me a course about artificial inteligence
* Recommend me a course that is 1 credit in CMSC
* Recommend me a course that is a DVUP gened in BMGT that teaches ethics

Here is the user flow:
* Enter major(s)
* Enter courses already taken
* Enter a search
* Get recommend courses based on search

### Tech Stack
* Frontend - React
* Backend - Fast API
