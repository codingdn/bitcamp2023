Organized chronologically, this class will provide students with a more thorough understanding of this period of art, as well as the overall connection of visual material to the social, the political, and the aesthetic frames of its production. We will study the ways in which African-American visual production has been shaped by larger discourses about American art, but has also responded to the very real circumstances of racial exclusion in both the mainstream art world and larger society. Students will also have a chance to interact directly with the collection of the David C. Driskell Center throughout the semester.","['Regular', 'Pass-Fail', 'Audit']","[['DSHU', 'DVUP']]",[],['ARTH362-0101'],,,,,,,

The position of women within avant-garde movements was complex as they fought for professional advancement while often being barred from mainstream art academies and facing limited opportunities. Nevertheless, many women carved out spaces of representation and their work critically adds to our understanding of avant-garde movements. We will examine the art production by women artists and the challenging artistic milieus they navigated during this time. We will also consider the current scholarship on women artists and the lenses through which art historians have previously studied them.","['Regular', 'Pass-Fail', 'Audit']",[],[],['ARTH389C-0101'],,,,,,,

You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers.

As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed.

Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.","['Regular', 'Pass-Fail', 'Audit']",[],[],['HESP150-PBH1'],,,,,,,

It may seem obvious that being poor in childhood has enduring effects on development. What is less obvious is how experiencing poverty in childhood shapes relationships between children and their surroundings, including family interactions, peer relationships, adult dynamics, and the health of the community. Less clear still is the extent to which positive interactions with caretakers and social supports can protect children from potential harm as they grow up. This course focuses on the complexity of poverty as a social force and community concern. Students will investigate the nature of poverty through an interdisciplinary lens that includes social theory, developmental psychology, and empirical studies. After analyzing various approaches to the study of child poverty, students will be in a position to use research on parenting and poverty to evaluate public policy and social programs in their own backyard.","['Regular', 'Pass-Fail']","[['DSSP', 'SCIS']]",[],['HNUH258B-0101'],,,,,HNUH258B is the required I-Series course in the Metamorphosis thematic cluster.

Complex organisms exhibit behaviors that both fascinate and confound, and the way an animal behaves dictates how it interacts with its environment, with profound consequences. Individual behaviors can have dramatic effects on individual fitness, an individual's groupmates, and even the evolution of species. This leads to a fundamental question in behavioral evolution: why do animals do the things they do? The answer lies in the interaction between individual experiences and eons of natural selection. In this seminar, students investigate what organisms were, what they have become, and why. With a focus on the transitions in behavior that caused single cells to evolve over time into complex societies, students will apply evolutionary principles to individual development and explore how and why individuals choose certain behaviors over others.","['Regular', 'Pass-Fail']",[['DSNS']],[],"['HNUH258U-0101', 'HNUH258U-0201']",,,,,HNUH258U is part of the Metamorphosis thematic cluster and pairs with HNUH258B to complete the cluster.

We will examine western relationships to the past as intimately tied to property and the drive to plunder, collect, and catalogue. Increasingly, conceptions of heritage include landscapes, as well as intangibles such as music, dance, and folklore. This broad definition honors the diversity of present-day relations to the past, even as it strains heritage management models that are organized around definitions and regulations, and bear the weight of historical injustice.

The project utilizes skills and knowledge gained through SPP coursework, expands students' integrative capacity, and serves as a bridge to professional opportunities. In this first half of a two-semester course sequence, students identify a client and problem, scope and define the problem, and draw up a plan of work. They perform background research on the problem, the context and relevant substantive domains. They also develop the research methodology for their project, which could include qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, or other approaches. Projects vary in substantive focus and may encompass policy analysis, program evaluation, management or organizational studies, or comprehensive literature reviews.","['Regular', 'Audit']",[],[],"['PLCY690-0101', 'PLCY690-0201', 'PLCY690-0521', 'PLCY690-0311']",,,PLCY699X.,Must be in a major in PLCY-School of Public Policy; or permission of PLCY-School of Public Policy.,,,PLCY690 or PLCY699X.

We then demonstrate how experiments can be used to evaluate causal hypotheses, and what options are available to conduct experiments in practice. Having discussed experimental data collection, we turn to the analysis of experiments, show how this, again, is linked to the logic of causal inference, and how to work with experimental data.

GLMs thus relate the expected mean E(Y) of the dependent variable to the predictor variables via a specific link function. This link function permits the expected mean to be non-linearly related to the predictor variables.
